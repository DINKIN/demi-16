# demi-16
Jacob M. Peck, 2012

## Overview
This is an emulator for the [DCPU-16](http://dcpu.com/highnerd/dcpu16.txt) architecture.

This emulator has no VRAM, no hardware emulation, and no interrupts.  This is a 
purely memory-mapped emulator for educational purposes.

## Why?
Because I've never written something like this, and it looks like an approachable 
project.

I'll be happy when I can be assured that it works enough to perform some simple
calculations (i.e., Fibonacci number generation), and most likely won't be testing
it thoroughly.  There may be an assembler included with this, but that is unlikely.

It is my goal to have this emulator binary-compatible with a specifications-abiding
assembler.
